# **Breast Cancer Classification using Naive Bayes**  

The goal of this project is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features extracted from breast cancer diagnostic data. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset provided by scikit-learn.

## **Project Overview**  
- **Dataset:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic (from scikit-learn)  
- **Algorithm:** Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC Curve  

## **Results**  

### **Confusion Matrix**  
The confusion matrix shows the true vs. predicted classifications:
